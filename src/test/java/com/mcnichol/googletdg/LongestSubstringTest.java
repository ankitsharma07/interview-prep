/**
 * Former Coding Interview Question:
 * Find longest word in dictionary that is a subsequence of a given string
 * Hone your problem-solving skills with this former Google interview question focused on strings.
 * It'll test your ability to optimize code and work with algorithms and data structures.
 * <p>
 * Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.
 * <p>
 * Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.
 * <p>
 * Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"
 * <p>
 * The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
 * The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
 * The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
 * Learning objectives
 * This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions.
